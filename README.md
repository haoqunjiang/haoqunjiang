#### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Haoqun Jiang from the Vue.js core team. I worked full-time on open source for Vue.js from 2018 to 2024.
I help maintain several Vue.js build tools and contribute to Vite, aiming to assist Vue.js users in navigating the fast-evolving web tooling landscape.

As of October 2024, I'm taking a break from most of my open-source work to recover from burnout.

I still occasionally work on important or interesting new features related to Vue/Vite.
You can sponsor my open-source work via [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/sodatea).

My current focus is on better ESLint 9 integration with Vue.js.
My previous work experience is listed on [haoqun.cv](https://haoqun.cv/).
