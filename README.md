#### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Haoqun Jiang, a member of the Vue.js core team. From 2018 to 2024, I worked full-time on open source for Vue.js.
I help maintain several Vue.js build tools and contribute to Vite, aiming to assist Vue.js users in navigating the fast-evolving web tooling landscape.

As of July 2024, I'm taking a break from most of my open-source work to recover from burnout.

I still occasionally work on important or interesting new features related to Vue/Vite.
You can sponsor my open-source work via [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/haoqunjiang).

My current focus is on better documentation and easier tooling for cutting-edge features of Vue.js, with tools such as [`install-vue`](https://github.com/haoqunjiang/install-vue#readme) and [@vue/tsconfig](https://github.com/vuejs/tsconfig).

My previous work experience is listed on [haoqun.cv](https://haoqun.cv/).
