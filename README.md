#### Hi there 👋

I'm Haoqun Jiang from the Vue.js core team, working full time on open source.

My job is to help Vue.js users connect the dots in the fast evolving web tooling landscape. So I help maintain Vue.js build tools and contribute to Vite.

You can sponsor my open source work via [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/sodatea) or [爱发电](https://www.afdian.net/@sodatea).

I track my current work publicly at https://github.com/users/sodatea/projects/1/views/1
