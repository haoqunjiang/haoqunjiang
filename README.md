#### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Haoqun Jiang from the Vue.js core team, working full-time on open source.

My job is to help Vue.js users connect the dots in the fast-evolving web tooling landscape.
So I help maintain several Vue.js build tools and contribute to Vite.

You can sponsor my open-source work via [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/sodatea), or [via OpenCollective to vuejs](https://opencollective.com/vuejs).
